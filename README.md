# TetrisGame
A simple version of the classic tetris game- the goal is to fill rows completely with the falling pieces.
Use the arrow keys to move the falling piece left or right. 
Hit the up arrow to rotate the piece. Hit the space bar to drop the piece. 
When a line is complete, it disappears and the player gets a point. If the pieces stack up to the top, the game ends.

The files: 
        hw6.py, 
        cmu_112_graphics.py, 
        cs112_f22_week6_linter.py 
must be saved in the same folder to run the game.
